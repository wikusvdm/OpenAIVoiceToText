# OpenAIVoiceToText
This takes a prompt from voice, converts it into a string, sends it to openai, then, finally, displays the response from an openai engine.
First, I run app.py from the directory folder. In this case, it's one found in downloads.
Next, I head over to the port given in the terminal.
Thereafter, I click on the button to record and go ahead.
After this, I go with "Y" in the terminal area such that the conversation can take place back to text.
Lastly, I'll witness an output of both my initial prompt and, of course, openai's response.
