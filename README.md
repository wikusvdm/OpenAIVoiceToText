# OpenAIVoiceToText
This takes a prompt from voice, converts it into a string, sends it to openai, then, finally, displays the response from an openai engine. It is a fascinating program that showcase a full stack application that can be used in customer service support scenarios, tailoring AI responses as per a given query.
First, I run app.py from the directory folder. In this case, it's one found in downloads.
Next, I head over to the port given in the terminal.
Thereafter, I click on the button to record and go ahead.
After this, I go with "Y" in the terminal area such that the conversation can take place back to text.
Lastly, I'll witness an output of both my initial prompt and, of course, openai's response.
This code - as with every other developer's arsenal - is only in the beginning phases. It could be adjusted for a better aesthetic, but I wanted to stress my skill for implementing the task: converting speech to a string of text, sending it to openai, and getting a response back.
